<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In the City of Angels, I'm Julia, your tech-savvy maverick in the legal cannabis industry. 
   By day, I navigate the digital landscape as a Technical Product Manager, specializing in 
   integrations and delivering top-notch developer experiences. When the sun goes down, you'll 
   find me immersed in the world of web development, crafting a digital revolution.
</p>

<p>Sharing my LA pad with the sleek and stylish Hannibal, my greyhound companion, we thrive on the vibrant 
   energy of the West Coast. I'm an adventurer at heart, chasing warm weather and live music wherever it 
   takes me. Catch me at happy hours, where I mix code and cocktails, and always hungry for new knowledge. 
   Life's a wild ride, and I'm here for every twist and turn.</p>
